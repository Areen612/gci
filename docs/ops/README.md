# Operations Runbooks Index

This directory stores detailed operational playbooks referenced in the main operations plan. Create documents as needed using the suggested naming convention:

- `deployment_runbook.md`
- `incident_response_playbook.md`
- `backup_restore_procedure.md`
- `monitoring_alert_tuning.md`
- `access_management_sop.md`
- `change_management_policy.md`

Each document should include:
1. Purpose and scope.
2. Roles and responsibilities.
3. Step-by-step procedures.
4. Escalation paths and contact information.
5. Validation or verification steps.

Keep runbooks version-controlled and update them after every significant process change or incident review.
