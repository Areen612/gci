# Store Operations Requirements Specification

## 1. Stakeholder Meeting Summary
- **Date:** 2024-??-?? (Workshop with store owner)
- **Participants:** Store owner, Solutions analyst (you)
- **Objective:** Understand existing workflows, identify pain points, and capture requirements for customer management, billing, and inventory operations.

## 2. Current Workflows and Pain Points

### 2.1 Customer Lookup
1. Staff searches paper loyalty cards or spreadsheets to locate customer contact information.
2. Purchase history is recorded manually after each sale.
3. Discount eligibility is determined by visually scanning notes from prior transactions.

**Pain Points**
- Manual search is slow, especially during peak hours.
- Data inconsistency because multiple spreadsheets exist for different registers.
- Difficult to spot high-value customers or tailor promotions without consolidated history.

### 2.2 Billing (Invoice Processing)
1. Sales associate records purchased items and prices on POS terminal.
2. Taxes and discounts are calculated manually using a printed rate chart.
3. Payment is recorded separately in the accounting system at day end.
4. Paper invoices are printed and filed for bookkeeping.

**Pain Points**
- Manual tax/discount calculations lead to pricing errors.
- No linkage between invoice and inventory adjustments, causing mismatched stock counts.
- Re-entering sales data into accounting software doubles the workload.
- Paper-based storage makes it hard to audit past invoices or respond to customer disputes.

### 2.3 Inventory Updates
1. Stock deliveries are logged in a warehouse spreadsheet with product codes and quantities.
2. Items sold are subtracted at the end of each day based on receipts.
3. Low-stock items are identified by visual inspection of shelves or by scanning spreadsheets weekly.

**Pain Points**
- Day-end reconciliation is time-consuming and prone to transcription errors.
- Lack of real-time inventory visibility causes frequent stockouts and over-ordering.
- No automatic alerts for low stock thresholds or pending purchase orders.
